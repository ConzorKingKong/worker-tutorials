# Cloudflare Worker Tutorials

This repo is a collection of different tutorials you can follow to create cool content with [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/).
Each folder has an `_index.md` file with the tutorial written inside of it, along with a `worker.js` file containing the
tutorial's code. You can put this code directly into the [Worker's Previewer](https://dash.cloudflare.com/workers/) and see it run!

## What is Workers

Workers allow you to deploy serverless apps to 165+ data centers across the globe simultaneously, along with the ability to
agument or alter exsisting websites and APIs on the fly.

## How Workers Work

Workers listen for a request on an endpoint, like a webhook, and respond to that request however you tell it to.
This can mean processing requests for your API or just returning cute cat pictures. Meow!

## There's a tutorial I'd like to see that isn't here. What do I do?

Make it our issue! Create an issue about any tutorial you'd like to see and possible use cases for it, and we'll see if we
can make a tutorial for you. Or if you're feeling super rad, make a PR with the tutorial and we'll add it into the repo.
